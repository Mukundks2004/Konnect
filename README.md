# Konnect: A Graph Utility

## Overview

Konnect is a powerful graph utility designed for creating, managing, and analyzing graphs. With an intuitive interactive tool, users can add and remove nodes and edges, save their graphs to files, and load existing graphs with ease. Whether you're a dev, data scientist, mathematician or hobbyist, Konnect provides the features you need to work with graphs effectively.

## Features

1. **Interactive Graph Creation**: Use a user-friendly interface to create graphs by simply clicking to add nodes and drawing edges between them.

2. **Add/Remove Nodes and Edges**: Easily add new nodes and edges, or remove existing ones with simple drag-and-drop functionality.

3. **File I/O Support**: Save your graph to a file in various formats (JSON, CSV) and load previously saved graphs for continued work.

4. **Cycle Detection**: Automatically identify cycles within the graph to help analyze connectivity and potential loops.

5. **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Use various pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, etc.) to find the shortest path between nodes.

10. **Export to Image**: Save your graph as an image (PNG, SVG) for inclusion in reports, presentations, or documentation.

12. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Easily revert or reapply changes made to the graph, ensuring a smooth user experience.

13. **Adjacency List/Matrix View**: Switch between graphical representation and adjacency list or matrix formats for a different perspective on graph structure.

Other features:
Here’s a list of 10-15 mathematical features you can implement in the Konnect graph utility:

1. **Pathfinding Algorithms**:
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
   - **A* Search Algorithm**: An efficient pathfinding algorithm that uses heuristics to improve performance.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse nodes by exploring as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. Useful for detecting cycles and exploring paths.

4. **Cycle Detection Algorithms**:
   - **Tarjan’s Algorithm**: Identify strongly connected components and detect cycles in directed graphs.
   - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Detect cycles and calculate shortest paths in weighted graphs.

5. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Another approach to finding the minimum spanning tree, focusing on growing the tree one edge at a time.

6. **Graph Representations**:
   - **Adjacency List**: Represent the graph using a list where each node has a list of connected nodes.
   - **Adjacency Matrix**: Represent the graph as a matrix, where the cell values indicate the presence or weight of edges between nodes.

7. **Topological Sorting**: For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), provide a way to order nodes such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, A comes before B.

8. **Graph Traversal Metrics**:
   - **Node and Edge Count**: Calculate the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
   - **Graph Density**: Measure the ratio of actual edges to possible edges in the graph.

9. **Clustering Coefficient**: Measure the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together, useful in social network analysis.

10. **Centrality Measures**:
    - **Degree Centrality**: Determine the importance of a node based on the number of connections.
    - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measure how often a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.

11. **PageRank Algorithm**: Calculate the importance of nodes based on their connections, useful for ranking web pages.

12. **Graph Coloring**: Implement algorithms for coloring the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, useful in scheduling problems.

13. **Eigenvalue Analysis**: Analyze the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix to study properties such as connectivity and stability.

14. **Flow Networks**: Implement algorithms like the Ford-Fulkerson method to calculate the maximum flow in a flow network.

15. **Planarity Testing**: Determine whether a graph can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing, useful in geographical mapping applications.
