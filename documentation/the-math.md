# There is a lot of math here!

I started this thinking about the comp sci graph perspective, cycles, dags, pathfinding, A* etc.

But it became a matter of physic-engine esque rearranging nodes! incredible!

There's a whole field of study dedicated to these algorithms.

!(Force Directed Graph Drawing)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing]

And trying to generalize these for non euclidean spaces is really cool- how do the graphs behave on the surface of a sphere or other interesting topologies?

My initial plan to offload the force part to d3 is actually what most people do! Because you need a proper physics engine for that. But I will nevertheless try to implement something, starting with Lombardi Spring Embedders.
